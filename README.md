# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised Learning and Crypto
## Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA (30 points)

Using your knowledge of Pandas, you’ll preprocess the dataset in order to perform PCA in Deliverable 2.

## Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA (20 points)

Using your knowledge of how to apply the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, you’ll reduce the dimensions of the X DataFrame to three principal components and place these dimensions in a new DataFrame.

## Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means (20 points)

Using your knowledge of the K-means algorithm, you’ll create an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for K from the pcs_df DataFrame created in Deliverable 2. Then, you’ll run the K-means algorithm to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrencies’ data.

## Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results (30 points)

Using your knowledge of creating scatter plots with Plotly Express and hvplot, you’ll visualize the distinct groups that correspond to the three principal components you created in Deliverable 2, then you’ll create a table with all the currently tradable cryptocurrencies using the hvplot.table() function.

## Objective: 
  - using **Unsupervised Machine Learning (UML)** methods; how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA
  - create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment
  - we use UML since we don't have a target in mind and just want to classify cryptocurrencies into different categories

## Results
Our Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques we used resulted in obtaining 4 different classifications to our cryptocurrencies.
